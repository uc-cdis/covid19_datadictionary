Instead of generic letters A, B, C, GISAID uses actual letters of marker mutations (alphabet for non-synonymous and number for synonymous substitutions) to make the system more tangible and specific for the virus."

The yearly reset of letters will ensure uniqueness, while the year-prefix provides immediate context on the origin of the clade that will become increasingly important going forward. These are meant as major genetic groupings and not intended to completely resolve genetic diversity."
